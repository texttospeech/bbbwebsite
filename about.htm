About us, the Banana Bot Builders
</h3>
<p>
	We are the Banana Bot Builders, a FLL team. For this year we are doing the challenge: Trash Trek. We talked to Waste Management officer
Paul Burns. He said that the biggest problem was educating people to recycle, compost, etc. correctly. So we created this website.
</p>
<h3>
FLL
</h3>
<p>
	FLL is an international 'lego league' a competition based on lego robotics and a project that varies from year to year. This year the
challenge is 'Trash Trek.' This means we have to solve a problem about trash. As you can see above, we decided to solve the prooblem of educating
people about what to do with what waste.
